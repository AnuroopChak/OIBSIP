# OIBSIP
It's a GitHub repository for the Oasis Infobyte Internship program. I have uploaded all projects which I have made in this Internship Journey.

The projects are -
- Unemployment Analysis with Python
- Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
### About the Company
**Oasis Infobyte** is a community of diverse people coming together with similar objectives and ultimate goals. It's all about creating opportunities for leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering shared interests. We develop enriching environments and experiences that promote students' knowledge and well-being.


# Unemployment Analysis
Analysing the dataset of unemploymnent rat eof India.

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate of a country. We all have seen a strike in the uemployment during Coid-19 Lockdown.
So analysis of the rate of unemployment during the lockdown period is done udsing Python.

1) The data is collected and extracted.
2) The Dataset is then formatted.
3) The EDA part is done using piecharts and bargraphs.
4) Then the analysis of the unemployment rate is done on the basis of states.
5) The an year wise analysis is also done.


# Spam-Mail-Prediction
The trained model can predict the input mail is whether a spam or ham.

We all have came across some spam mail which usually contains junk or unnecessary messages.
So a machine learning model is built to classify the spam or ham emails.

1) In this project at first the dataset is collected and the data exploration is done.
2) Then comes the Data analysis part.
3) The data is then splittted into train and test datasets.
4) In the next step a logistic regression model is prepared.
5) The model is then trained using train dataset.
6) Then the test dataset is used to check whether the model is fit.
7) Then a random mail is predicted by model if it is spam or ham.
