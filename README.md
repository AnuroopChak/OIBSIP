# Spam-Mail-Prediction
The trained model can predict the input mail is whether a spam or ham.

We all have came across some spam mail which usually contains junk or unnecessary messages.
So a machine learning model is built to classify the spam or ham emails.

1) In this project at first the dataset is collected and the data exploration is done.
2) Then comes the Data analysis part.
3) The data is then splittted into train and test datasets.
4) In the next step a logistic regression model is prepared.
5) The model is then trained using train dataset.
6) Then the test dataset is used to check whether the model is fit.
7) Then a random mail is predicted by model if it is spam or ham.
